-------------

__2012-11-13__

- Improved memory management

  * Destroyed objects are returned to the cache and re-used later

- Replace `continuable_writer` with `continuable_io : continuable_reader`
- No more multiple inheritance in `default_peer` (derives `continuable_io`)
- MM reports IO failures to corresponding objects
- New behavior in default protocol regarding outgoing messages:
  * `default_peer` uses FIFO queue for outgoing messages
  * queue stores messages even if no active connection is available
  * new connections then check for previously enqueued messages first

Version 0.5
-----------

__2012-10-26__

- New logging facility
  * must be enabled using --with-cppa-log-level=LEVEL (TRACE-ERROR)
  * --enable-debug also enables ERROR log level implicitly

  * MM provides run_later function to hook code into MM event-loop
- New class: `weak_intrusive_ptr`
  * `ref_counted` has protected destructor to enforce use of `request_deletion`
  * default `request_deletion` calls `delete`
  * `enable_weak_ptr_mixin` overrides `request_deletion` to invalidate weak ptrs
- Fixed issue #75: peers hold weak pointers to proxies (breaks cyclic refs)
- `actor_companion_mixin` allows non-actor classes to communicate as/to actors
- `actor_proxy` became an abstract class; must be implemented for each protocol
- Removed global proxy cache singleton
