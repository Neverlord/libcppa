/**
 * An actor poool is a lightweight abstraction for a set of workers.
 * The pool itself is an actor, meaning that it can be passed
 * around in an actor system to hide the actual set of workers.
 *
 * After construction, new workers can be added via `{'SYS', 'PUT', actor}`
 * messages, e.g., `send(my_pool, sys_atom::value, put_atom::value, worker)`.
 * `{'SYS', 'DELETE', actor}` messages remove a worker from the set,
 * whereas `{'SYS', 'GET'}` returns a `vector<actor>` containing all workers.
 *
 * Note that the pool *always*  sends exit messages to all of its workers
 * when forced to quit. The pool monitors all of its workers. Messages queued
 * up in a worker's mailbox are lost, i.e., the pool itself does not buffer
 * and resend messages. Advanced caching or resend strategies can be
 * implemented in a policy.
 *
 * It is wort mentioning that the pool is *not* an event-based actor.
 * Neither does it live in its own thread. Messages are dispatched immediately
 * during the enqueue operation. Any user-defined policy thus has to dispatch
 * messages with as little overhead as possible, because the dispatching
 * runs in the context of the sender.
