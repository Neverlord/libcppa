\section{Strongly Typed Actors}

Strongly typed actors provide a convenient way of defining type-safe messaging interfaces.
Unlike ``dynamic actors'', typed actors are not allowed to change their behavior at runtime, neither are typed actors allowed to use guard expressions.
When calling \lstinline^become^ in a strongly typed actor, the actor will be killed with exit reason \lstinline^unallowed_function_call^.

Typed actors use \lstinline^typed_actor_ptr<...>^ instead of \lstinline^actor_ptr^, whereas the template parameters hold the messaging interface.
For example, an actor responding to two integers with a dobule would use the type \lstinline^typed_actor_ptr<replies_to<int, int>::with<double>>^.

All functions for message passing, linking and monitoring are overloaded to accept both types of actors.
As of version 0.8, strongly typed actors cannot be published and do not support message priorities (those are planned feature for future releases).

\subsection{Spawning Typed Actors}
\label{sec:strong:spawn}

Actors are spawned using the function \lstinline^spawn_typed^.
The argument to this function call \emph{must} be a match expression as shown in the example below, because the runtime of libcppa needs to evaluate the signature of each message handler.

\begin{lstlisting}
auto p0 = spawn_typed(
  on_arg_match >> [](int a, int b) {
   return static_cast<double>(a) * b;
  },
  on_arg_match >> [](double a, double b) {
    return make_cow_tuple(a * b, a / b);
  }
);
// assign to identical type
using full_type = typed_actor_ptr<
                    replies_to<int, int>::with<double>,
                    replies_to<double, double>::with<double, double>
                  >;
full_type p1 = p0;
// assign to subtype
using subtype1 = typed_actor_ptr<
                   replies_to<int, int>::with<double>
                 >;
subtype1 p2 = p0;
// assign to another subtype
using subtype2 = typed_actor_ptr<
                   replies_to<double, double>::with<double, double>
                 >;
subtype2 p3 = p0;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Class-based Typed Actors}

Typed actors can be implemented using a class by inheriting from \lstinline^typed_actor<...>^, whereas the template parameter pack denotes the messaging interface.
Derived classes have to implemented the pure virtual member function \lstinline^make_behavior^, as shown in the example below.

\begin{lstlisting}
// implementation
class typed_testee : public typed_actor<replies_to<int>::with<bool>> {

 protected:

  behavior_type make_behavior() final {
    // returning a non-matching expression 
    // results in a compile-time error
    return (
      on_arg_match >> [](int value) {
        return value == 42;
      }
    );
  }

};

// instantiation
auto testee = spawn_typed<typed_testee>();
\end{lstlisting}

It is worth mentioning that \lstinline^typed_actor^ implements the member function \lstinline^init()^ using the \lstinline^final^ qualifier.
Hence, derived classes are not allowed to override \lstinline^init()^.
However, typed actors are allowed to override other member functions such as \lstinline^on_exit()^.
The return type of \lstinline^make_behavior^ is \lstinline^typed_behavior<...>^, which is aliased as \lstinline^behavior_type^ for convenience.
