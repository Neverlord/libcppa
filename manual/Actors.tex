\section{Actors}

\libcppa provides several actor implementations, each covering a particular use case.
The class \lstinline^local_actor^ is the base class for all implementations, except for (remote) proxy actors.
Hence, \lstinline^local_actor^ provides a common interface for actor operations like trapping exit messages or finishing execution.
The default actor implementation in \libcppa is event-based.
Event-based actors have a very small memory footprint and are thus very lightweight and scalable.
Context-switching actors are used for actors that make use of the blocking API (see Section \ref{Sec::BlockingAPI}), but do not need to run in a separate thread.
Context-switching and event-based actors are scheduled cooperatively in a thread pool.
Thread-mapped actors can be used to opt-out of this cooperative scheduling.

%\subsection{Local Actors}

%The class \lstinline^local_actor^ describes a local running actor.
%It provides a common interface for actor operations like trapping exit messages or finishing execution.

\subsection{The ``Keyword'' \texttt{self}}

The \lstinline^self^ pointer is an essential ingredient of our design.
It identifies the running actor similar to the implicit \lstinline^this^ pointer identifying an object within a member function.
Unlike \lstinline^this^, though, \lstinline^self^ is not limited to a particular scope.
The \lstinline^self^ pointer is used implicitly, whenever an actor calls functions like \lstinline^send^ or \lstinline^become^, but can be accessed to use more advanced actor operations such as linking to another actor, e.g., by calling \lstinline^self->link_to(other)^.
The \lstinline^self^ pointer is convertible to \lstinline^actor_ptr^ and \lstinline^local_actor*^, but it is neither copyable nor assignable.
Thus, \lstinline^auto s = self^ will cause a compiler error, while \lstinline^actor_ptr s = self^ works as expected.

A thread that accesses \lstinline^self^ is converted on-the-fly to an actor if needed.
Hence, ``everything is an actor'' in \libcppa.
However, automatically converted actors use an implementation based on the blocking API, which behaves slightly different than the default, i.e., event-based, implementation.
